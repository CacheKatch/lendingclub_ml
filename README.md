This repository is to explore results of different Machine learning techniques into loan approvals

The repository is comprised of 2 notebooks: \
&ensp; **notebook 1:** named credit_risk_resampling \
&ensp; **notebook 2:** named credit_risk_ensemble 

### **Notebook 1: credit_risk_resamplig:**
In this notebook, a series of sampling balancing techniques are tested to compare their results using the Logistic Regression (machine learning) process. The sampling balancing tested methods are: 1) Random Oversampling, 2) SMOTE Oversampling, 3) Undersampling and 4) Combination Resampling.
